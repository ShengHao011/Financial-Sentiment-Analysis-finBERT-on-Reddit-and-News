# Sentiment_Analysis_Reddit_Posts
This project provides a market sentiment analysis pipeline using FinBERT on real-time reddit/subreddit posts and financial news. The code takes in data from different subreddits using the Reddit API PRAW, as well as news articles using News API. After collecting the data, the project applies the finBERT model to determine whether the overall sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative, producing a sentiment score.
